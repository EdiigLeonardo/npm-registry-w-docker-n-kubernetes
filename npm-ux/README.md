# NPM EXPLORE LIBRARY

## Resume
This document is a UX design document for the  **NPM Registry Explorer application**, which aims to provide users with an **efficient way** to search the NPM registry for packages and access detailed information about them. 
The application can be used in both desktop **(Windows 11 Pro, Debian v10.)** and web environments **(Chromium Browser 2023, Mozilla FireFox 2023)**, and users can search for packages using various criteria such as name of package and keywords. The application has been tested on desktop environments such as Windows 11 Pro and Debian v10.
The app also displays important information about the NPM registry such as uuid, db_name and engine. 
The prototype includes four pages: Home, Npm Registry Status Monitor, Npm Library Search and Library Info Hub. 
The app uses Open Sans font, background color #f5f8fa **(Gainsboro)**, border color #abddff **(Light Steel Blue)**, button color #ffffff **(white)** and grids color #ffffff **(white)**.

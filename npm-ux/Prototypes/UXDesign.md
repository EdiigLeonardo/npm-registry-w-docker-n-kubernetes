# User eXperience design

## User Story

### Searching for a Package

As a software developer, we wanted to create an application that would allow me to easily search and find packages in the NPM registry, for anyone looking to incorporate them into their projects quickly.

To achieve this goal, we need to enter a search expression which can be the name of the package itself or an associated keyword. The result should, among many things, include the package name, the package description, and the keywords of the package. We also need to view detailed information about the packages, including the package name, description, dist tags for the latest version, home page, and license for the latest version.

### Viewing NPM Registry Information

Additionally, we want to view the overall state of the NPM registry, including important information like uuid, db_name, and engine. This will help us understand the registry better and make more informed decisions when selecting packages for my projects.

### Accessing the Application on Different Devices

As a developer working on multiple devices, we need the app to be available on:
- Desktop:
    * Debian v.10;
    * Windows 11 Pro:
- Web 
    * Chromium 2023;
    * Firefox 2023;

so we can use it no matter where We're working.

Overall, the NPM Registry Explorer application will help us save time and be more productive by providing an easy and efficient way to search and locate packages in the NPM registry.
